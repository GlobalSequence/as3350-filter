# AS3350 4 Pole LPF - 2 Pole HPF

This is a filter built around the Alfa Rpar AS3350 VCF chip. Sounds nice.

# ATTENTION!

This is not a finished design and requires some tweaking to the Resonance and Cutoff portions.

This schematic was designed around a verified breadboard build, but since I made the schematic after the breadboard build, I would not consider the schematic itself 'verified'. Build at your own risk. 

Also, don't forget your decoupling caps on all the ICs!
